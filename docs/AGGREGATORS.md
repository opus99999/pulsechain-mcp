# Aggregators — Piteas, Switch, and swap assist

Quote and prepare tools are **advisory assists**. They do **not** broadcast. Execution stays on the wallet path under operator-trust.

---

## Which tool when

| Tool | Key | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| **`piteas_quote`** | None (keyless) | **Default** aggregator quote assist |
| **`piteas_prepare_swap`** | None | Quote → reviewable intent (`to` / `data` / `value`) |
| **`piteas_propose_agent_swap`** | Wallet mode | Fresh quote → strict decode → same-process proposal without returning raw calldata |
| **`switch_quote`** | Operator `SWITCH_API_KEY` | Switch.win quote; public unauthenticated → 401 |
| **`switch_prepare_swap`** | Needs successful keyed quote | Intent from **upstream `tx.to` / `tx.data` / `tx.value` only** |
| `pulseswap_quote` | None | Multi-DEX advisory |
| `pulsex_quote` / `prepare_swap` | None | PulseX router path only |

Neither Piteas nor Switch is a **best-price oracle**. Prefer addresses over symbols for tokenIn/tokenOut.

### Switch keys (operator-gated)

1. Human operator requests access: https://docs.switch.win/aggregator/request-api-key  
2. Set `SWITCH_API_KEY` in **local env only** (never commit).  
3. **Agents cannot self-serve keys** inside this MCP.  
4. Until keyed, prefer **`piteas_quote`**.

## End-to-end swap path

```text
1. piteas_quote (or switch_quote if operator key present)
2. Confirm quoteReady / amounts look sane
3. piteas_prepare_swap (or switch_prepare_swap)
4. [wallets on] propose_agent_tx with prepared to/data/value
5. Read reviewSummary + safetyHints + agentGuidance
6. execute_agent_tx with confirm=true (or MRTR) — only after review
```

**Stale-quote rule:** quotes expire; re-quote before send if delayed, market moved, prepare failed, or `quoteReady` is false. Never reuse old calldata.

For long Piteas aggregator calldata, prefer `piteas_propose_agent_swap` when wallet mode is enabled. It obtains one fresh quote, keeps the exact calldata inside the MCP process, runs strict top-level Piteas decode plus native wallet inspection and same-block RPC simulation, then saves one pending proposal only if all checks pass. It does not expose raw calldata in normal output and does not sign, submit, broadcast, execute, or create approvals.

See [AGENT_GUIDANCE.md](AGENT_GUIDANCE.md) for the durable checklist and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for wallet essentials.

## What “prepare” is not

- Not a signed transaction  
- Not a broadcast  
- Not approval of spend  
- Not a guarantee of minOut after delay  

Native PLS sells include human `valuePls` for review; gas is **additional** PLS on PulseChain.
